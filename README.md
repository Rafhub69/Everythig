# Everything
Here is the most advanced program I have ever made, it is over 3,000 lines of code long.
The basic functionalities are:
- Lisajous table
- Nbonaci Sequence
- Nth degree pendulum
- Double and single pendulum
- Balls having their own gravitational field
- Balls in a gravitational field (like on Earth)
